My dotfiles, managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

### warning!
This project is in a really early stage. The idea is to converge together with my Vagrant setups, and find the Grail of
one-command machine building, complete with needed packages, terminal configs, editor plugins and no stress. Needless to
say that it's a long way from here.
